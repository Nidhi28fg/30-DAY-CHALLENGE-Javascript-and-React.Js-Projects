import React from 'react'

const UserContext = React.createContext()

   // react.createcontext is used for creating a context. It's a pure JavaScript component that wraps a React component.
  // The context provides a variable, which is called a provider.
export default UserContext;

// The UserContext is a pure JavaScript component. That's why its name is UserContext.js.
